This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablevalueset|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Information about pinned versions
Pinned the version of http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/application-feature/StructureDefinition/FeatureDefinition to 1.0.0 from choices of 1.0.0 (hl7.fhir.uv.application-feature#1.0.0), {{unversioned}} (null)
