# Setting jurisdiction to 001 'World' causes the following informational message

Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# The code systems in this IG need heavy review during ballot. They might change significantly or even be removed. 

INFORMATION: CodeSystem/processing-status-cs: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Extensions that don't match a slice in the sharablevalueset profile, which is not a problem

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablevalueset|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Information about pinned versions
Pinned the version of http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/application-feature/StructureDefinition/FeatureDefinition to 1.0.0 from choices of 1.0.0 (hl7.fhir.uv.application-feature#1.0.0), {{unversioned}} (null)

# Skipping the OID for this example, as not important

The resource CapabilityStatement/FeatureCapabilityStatementExample could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)
