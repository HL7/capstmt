# Acknowledge binding applies to all types

The element FeatureDefinition.versionAlgorithm[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([string, Coding]). The binding will apply to all the types

# Invalid warnings, the in/out profiles do have "feature" pararmeters.

The 'in' profile does not have a parameter 'feature' but it is in the parameters list in the operation definition
The 'out' profile does not have a parameter 'feature' but it is in the parameters list in the operation definition

# Setting jurisdiction to 001 'World' causes the following informational message

# The code systems in this IG need heavy review during the trial use period. They might change significantly or even be removed. Will revisit in the next release.

INFORMATION: CodeSystem/processing-status-cs: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Extensions that don't match a slice in the sharablevalueset profile, which is not a problem

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablevalueset|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)


# Skipping the OID for this example, as not important

The resource CapabilityStatement/FeatureCapabilityStatementExample could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)

# The code system in question is for an example instance only, and thus should not be in THO

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
